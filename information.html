        <p>
          My main goal is to offer a pleasant and enjoyable experience for
          everyone.

        <h2>User Role</h2>
        <p>
          When you commission me for the first time, you get access to your own
          section on the website in the "Users" area, where you can check your
          badges and coupons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every user has the option to create their own page. If you prefer not
          to, that‚Äôs totally okay. You can read more about this in the "Privacy"
          section.
        </p>

      <section class="info-section" id="commissions">

        <p>
          This section is entirely dedicated to users. You‚Äôll be able to see all
          the people who have commissioned me (only if they agreed to create
          their own section).
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll also find ratings and comments from previous clients to help
          build trust and transparency.

      <section class="info-section" id="privacy">
        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Your comfort is a priority. Please let me know from the start if you
          prefer not to have a public profile in the "Users" section.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't want your commission details revealed, it will simply
          appear as "Anonymous Commission", since I still need to indicate that
          I‚Äôm working on something.

          monthly raffles and other events.

          user. How you earn them varies ‚Äî each one is part of a unique and
          personalized experience.

          No need to sign up. If you already have a section in the "Users" page,
